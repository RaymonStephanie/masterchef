# Recipe:
- [ ] Take a pan, smear it with oil and heat it.
- [ ] Break eggs in a bowl, mix well.

- [ ] Take a ladle, scoop out the egg mix into the pan.

> You can have a whole omlette, or you could scramble it.
I'd continue with whole omlette as that is my fav and its very :yummy:
- [ ] Spread the omlette evenly across the pan. 
- [ ] Add a pinch of salt :salt:, and the vegetables :salad:.
