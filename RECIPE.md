# Recipe:
- [ ] Take a pan, smear it with oil and heat it.
- [ ] Break eggs in a bowl, mix well.
- [ ] You may also dice shallots, shred carrot and dice tomatoes and have them separately. These add to the flavour.
- [ ] Take a ladle, scoop out the egg mix into the pan.
- [ ] From here, there are two ways..
> You can have a whole omlette, or you could scramble it.
I'd continue with whole omlette as that is my fav and its very tasty.
- [ ] Spread the omlette evenly across the pan. 
- [ ] Add a pinch of salt :salt:, and the vegetables :carrot:, :tomato:, :onion:.
- [ ] Then let it cook for some :stopwatch:
- [ ] Turn the omlette over and repeat the previous step.
_Before serving, please add the seasoning you like! I love oregano, you could use chilly flakes, but generally :pizza: seasoning makes it good._
